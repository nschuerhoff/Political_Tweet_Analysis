Data Science 340 Research Project:

Political communication over social media is an increasingly vital part of how political leaders interact with their constituency, especially considering it is the younger generations and future voters who primarily occupy these online spaces. I want to measure the differences in how the two political parties (Democrats and Republicans) communicate with their bases via twitter using NLP and determine if there is a noteable difference in both the topics tweeted about, and how these topics are presented.

I will select 4 of the most popular political leaders on twitter currently in office from each party, scrape their most recent 300 tweets and pull the most popular lemmatized nouns from each tweet. Compiling and counting these nouns will give me a fair understanding of the most popular topics tweeted about among Democrats and Republicans.

The second part of my analysis will seek to quantify differences (if any) in the type of language political leaders use to communicate with their constituency online. Using the collections of tweets from both parties, I will execute sentiment analysis on each tweet from each user and procure their respective subjectivity and polarity scores. Once I have these metrics, I will plot the respective subjectivity and polarity scores and run K-Neares-Neighbor clustering to try and see if there is a measurable difference in the way Republicans and Democrats communicate with their constituency.
